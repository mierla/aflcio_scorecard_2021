As working people, we look for the Legislature to:\\n\\n- Reflect our core values of fairness, solidarity and economic justice;\\n\\n- Do everything within its power to support workers and their families;\\n\\n- And take proactive measures to create a just economy.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis legislative scorecard seeks to capture the votes that were of the greatest importance to working people in the first session of the 130th Maine Legislature (2021). It provides information on those bills and lets you know how your legislators voted.\\n\\nOur Legislative Committee and Executive Board carefully reviewed all the bills that came before the State Legislature and selected which bills to work on and to score. We hope you find the scorecard useful and that you will use it to hold your state legislators accountable."},{"heading":"About the AFL-CIO","paragraph":"The Maine AFL-CIO is a statewide federation of more than 160 local labor unions in Maine. We represent more than 40,000 Maine workers and retirees delivering public services or working at paper mills, shipyards, hospitals, construction sites, utilities, and in many other industries.

"},{"Question":"What is the \\"Will of the Voters\\" score? ","Answer":"This score looks specifically at votes over the last two years that had to do with upholding or rolling back citizen initiatives passed by voters, or messing with the referendum process. (Examples include the vote to roll back the minimum wage increase, and the vote to repeal the Stand Up for Students education surcharge, and a number of votes to make it harder to get on the ballot for a citizen initiative.) "},{"Question":"Why are some bills scored in the House and not the Senate, and vice-versa? ","Answer":"We score bills that received a \u201croll call\u201d vote (where the individual yes or no votes on a bill are recorded). Not every bill receives a \u201croll call\u201d in both chambers. Sometimes that\u2019s because the vote was never taken up by one of the chambers (such as was the case with a number of bills that died after House Republicans voted against extending the legislative session). Other times it\u2019s because the bill passed \u201cunder the hammer,\u201d meaning unanimously. We can\u2019t score a bill if we don\u2019t know how each legislator voted on it, so there are a few cases where we could only score it in the House or the Senate. "},{"Question":"Why do absences count against legislators?","Answer":"When legislators are elected to serve the people, their job is to show up. In recent years, the voting margins have been so slim that a single missing member of the House or Senate could pass or kill a bill. Unless an absence is excused, we do count absences against a legislator\u2019s score, because we can\u2019t differentiate between somebody missing a day in Augusta and somebody who\u2019s \u201ctaking a walk\u201d to avoid casting a vote.

","Answer":"First: Please share this scorecard. Every Maine has the right to know how their elected officials voted, and whether they were actually representing their constituents -or the interests of the wealthy and corporations. \\n\\nSecond: Get involved. Write or call your legislator to tell them your thoughts on their votes. And the ultimate form of accountability? Elections. We\u2019ve got a big one coming up in November. \\n\\nYou can see if your legislators are up for re-election when you look up their score. Happy with how they voted? Volunteer to knock on some doors, make phone calls, and help get them back in office. (And throw them five dollars if they\u2019re running as a clean elections candidate here: https://www5.informe.org/cgi-bin/online/ethics/cleanelection/home.pl) Unhappy with their score? Volunteer with the person challenging them.
